# Security Policy

At [Mountain Protocol](https://mountainprotocol.com), we take security as our first principle and implement measures to guarantee that we're delivering secure code. The USDM smart contract has undergone an in-depth secure development process, including a thorough [audit by OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/mountainprotocol/audits), a leading firm in Blockchain security.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
